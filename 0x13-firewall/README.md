# Firewall

In this project, I used `ufw` to configure firewalls on my issued web servers.
In computing, a firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.[1] A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the Internet.
## Tasks :page_with_curl:

 

* **0. Block all incoming traffic but**
  * [0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but](./0-block_all_incoming_traffic_but): Bash
  script that installs a `ufw` firewall to block all incoming traffic except for
  ports `22`, `443` and `80` on a web server.


#  Requirements:

The requirements below must be applied to web-01 (feel free to do it on lb-01 and web-02, but it wonâ€™t be checked)
Configure ufw so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
* 22 (SSH)
* 443 (HTTPS SSL)
* 80 (HTTP)
* Share the ufw commands that you used in your answer file

* **1. Port forwarding**
  * [100-port_forwarding](./100-port_forwarding): `ufw` configuration file that
  configures a firewall to redirect port `8080/TCP` to port `80/TCP`.
