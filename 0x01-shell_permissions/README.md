# Shell, permissions

In this project, I learned about using the `chmod`, `sudo`, `su`, `chown`, and
`chgrp` commands to represent and change Linux file permissions and change users
in the Shell.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. My name is Betty**
  * [0-iam_betty](./0-iam_betty): Bash script that changes the user ID to `betty`.

* **1. Who am I**
  * [1-who_am_i](./1-who_am_i): Bash script that prints the effective userid of the
  current user.
  
  * **2. Groups**
  * [2-groups](./2-groups): Bash script that prints all the groups the
  current user is a part of.

  file `hello` to the user `betty`.
