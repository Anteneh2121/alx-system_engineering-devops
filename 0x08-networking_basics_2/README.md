# Networking basics #1

This project was the second of two introducing networking. I continued to learn
about IP addresses while practicing manipulating them with Bash scripts.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Change your home IP**
  * [2-change_your_home_IP](./2-change_your_home_IP): Bash script that configures
  an Ubuntu server as follows:
  * `localhost` resolves to `127.0.0.2`
  * `facebook.com` resolves to `8.8.8.8`

* **1. Show attached IPs**
  * [3-show_attached_IPs](./3-show_attached_IPs): Bash script that displays all active IPv4
  IP's on the machine.
